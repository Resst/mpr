	abstract = {The fuzzy VIKOR method has been developed to solve fuzzy multicriteria problem with conflicting and noncommensurable (different units) criteria. This method solves problem in a fuzzy environment where both criteria and weights could be fuzzy sets. The triangular fuzzy numbers are used to handle imprecise numerical quantities. Fuzzy VIKOR is based on the aggregating fuzzy merit that represents distance of an alternative to the ideal solution. The fuzzy operations and procedures for ranking fuzzy numbers are used in developing the fuzzy VIKOR algorithm. VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOmpromisno Resenje) focuses on ranking and selecting from a set of alternatives in the presence of conflicting criteria, and on proposing compromise solution (one or more). It is extended with a trade-offs analysis. A numerical example illustrates an application to water resources planning, utilizing the presented methodology to study the development of a reservoir system for the storage of surface flows of the Mlava River and its tributaries for regional water supply. A comparative analysis of results by fuzzy VIKOR and few different approaches is presented.}
